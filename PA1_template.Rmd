## Loading and preprocessing the data

#install "ggplot2" and "reshape2" packages.
##Downloaded activity.csv in same directory
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")




## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
meltedActivity <- melt(activity, id=c("date"), na.rm=TRUE, measure.vars="steps")
castedActivity <- dcast(meltedActivity, date ~ variable, sum)
hist(castedActivity$steps)
actMean <- format(round(mean(castedActivity$steps), 2), nsmall = 2)
actMedian <- median(castedActivity$steps)

#The mean is 10766.19 and the median is 10765.


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
